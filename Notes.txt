Notes:
`````

controller -- GetMapping("/{id}") this will navigates to a service
service -- logic (for example to getAll, it is "return studentRepo.findAll();")
model -- structure of table (table in MySQL workbench will be automatically created when code is executed)
repository -- we use repo of model to make changes to that model
